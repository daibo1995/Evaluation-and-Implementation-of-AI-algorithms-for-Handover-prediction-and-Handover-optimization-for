# Evaluation-and-Implementation-of-AI-algorithms-for-Handover-prediction-and-Handover-optimization-for
Three AI algorithms are included A2C DQN andPPO

In training, three algorithms are included.

in model_dataset, the code is used to generate the result with channel model

in Evaluation, how I get the results in the environment using trained model to predict.

The collected results were included in the zip file
